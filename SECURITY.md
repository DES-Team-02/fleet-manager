# Security Policy

This project implements the [Eclipse Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We recommend that in case of suspected vulnerabilities you do not create a GitHub issue, but instead contact the
Eclipse Security Team directly sending an email to security@eclipse.org.
