This package contains *protobuf* definitions and corresponding Rust code bindings for the types defined by the
[FMS specific VSS overlay](../../spec).

The [FMS Forwarder](../fms-forwarder) and [FMS Server](../fms-server) components use these bindings to serialize
and deserialize FMS data being sent from a vehicle to the back end.
