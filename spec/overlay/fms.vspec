Vehicle.ADAS.CruiseControl.IsActive:
  datatype: boolean
  type: sensor
  description: |
    Indicates if cruise control is switched on. It is not ensured that the engine is controlled by cruise control,
    as in the case of a large driver's demand the engine is controlled by the driver while cruise control is active
    (maximum selection of cruise control and driver's demand). The cruise control is set to false if a switch-off
    condition occurs.

Vehicle.ADAS.CruiseControl.IsBrakePressed:
  datatype: boolean
  type: sensor
  description: |

    This brake foot pedal is controlling the vehicles' service brake (total vehicle braking application,
    not park brakes).  It is necessary for safe drivetrain behavior that the switch activates before the
    physical braking components are activated (i.e. Disengage the cruise control function prior to the
    activation of friction brakes)
